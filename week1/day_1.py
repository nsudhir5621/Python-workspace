# Task
# Given an integer,n, perform the following conditional actions:
# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

# n = int(input())
# if n % 2 != 0: #To check that the number is odd
#     print("Weird")
# else:
#     if 2 <= n <= 5:
#         print("Not Weird")
#     elif 6 <= n <= 20:
#         print("Weird")
#     elif n > 20:
#         print("Not Weird")

# Python: Arithmetic Operators
# Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# a = int(input())
# b = int(input())
# print (a+b)
# print (a-b)
# print (a*b)
